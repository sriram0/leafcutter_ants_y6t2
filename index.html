                Found in Central and South America, Leafcutter ants, belonging to the genera <em>Atta</em> and <em>Acromyrmex</em>, are the world's first agriculturists. The reddish brown workers form trails up to a hundred metres long in search of fresh leaves to bring back to the colony where it is consumed by a domesticated fungus which is what the ants eat. Leafcutter Ant colonies can number up to eight million and can live over twenty years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leafcutter ants, like all ants, are eusocial insects of the order <em>Hymenoptera</em>. Almost all Hymenopterans are either eusocial or parasitiod. Eusociality is fairly rare elsewhere; termites are the only other fairly large clade of eusocial animals. Then, there is a single beetle species, a few crustaceans and two species of mammals. Thats about it. But what does it mean to be eusocial? Eusociality is when a group of organisms (usually called a colony) of the same species are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Differentiated into different castes. There must be at least two castes, queens and workers</li>
                <li>Brood care must be cooperative</li>
                <li>At least two generations of workers overlap</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each caste is morphologically and behaviouly different. Workers, for example, gather food, expand the nest and care for brood. The queen (or queens) doesn't do any of that; at least after the first workers emerge. In termites, a king is also present. Most termites and some ants also have a distinct soldier/major caste which specilise in nest defense and combat, including Leafcutters. Some species of ants also have supermajors. Leafcutter Ants don't have supermajors but they do have minims, minors, media and majors in addition to the queen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Eusociality evolved independantly several times in <em>Hymenoptera</em>. This is because of a quirk shared by all Hymenopterans, even ones that aren't eusocial: haplodiploidy, which makes it more favourable to form colonies under the right conditions. Termites evolved eusociality once and diverged into numerous species. It may have originated in shrimp twice and once in rodents, though they aren't capable of obligate eusociaity.

                In the right conditions, eusociality is a very powerful tool. If you isolate an ant from its colony, it will just wander around aimlessly. But an entire colony can gather food, engage in contruction projects, defend the nest, wage war and in Leafcutter Ants, cultivate fungi. A colony of ants is a superorganism. A trail of ants is but a tentacle to gather food and massacre anything that tries to stop it before joining back with the rest of the superorganism underground, somewhat analogous to the psuedopodia of amoeba. Unless, of course, we're talking about Weaver Ants live high in the canopy, glueing leaves together to form their nest. Then the long tendrils would creep around branches following the same murder spree. Even better, the tentacles of some species can sting and some others can fire formic acid. 
            </p>

                The agricultural revolution in humans began 10,000 years ago. The ansectors of Leafcutters, early members belonging to the tribe Attini, began farming about 60 million years ago. That's 60,000,000 years ago. 65 million years ago the Deccan Traps exploded, the asteroid hit and the non-avian dinosaurs were wiped of the face of the planet. Not long after, ants began farming. Initially, they fed their fungi rotting leaves and other decaying material. The lower attines, as they are called, include the genera <em>Apterostigma, Myrmicocrypta, Mycocepurus, Mycetophylax, Mycetarotes, Mycetosoritis, Cyphomyrmex</em> and <em>Mycetagroicus</em>. Eventually, about 20 million years ago, <em>higher</em> attines appeared, like the genera <em>Trachymyrmex</em> and <em>Sericomyrmex</em>. Instead of feeding thier fungi rotting material, they brought it freshly cut leaves and flowers. 15  million years ago, true Leafcutter Ants appeared, which exclusively bring fresh leaves to their underground fungal gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we think of a colony of attines as superorganisms again, then they're essentially herbivores. This time, the upto 100m long tentacles are in search of leaves to bring back to the creature's underground home where fungal 'gut bacteria' break them down and supply the 'cellular' ants with nourishment. But just because it's a herbivore, doesn't mean it's harmless. The tentacles can sport huge Major 'immune cells' to defend against any potentially ant-eating 'parasitic' threats and wage war against rival superorganisms. Almost anything visible with the unaided eye can eliminate a single ant. A frog or other vertabrate or even some arthropods could abolish a juvenile superoranism yet to reach a hundred, but nothing can even get close to defeating a mature superorgansim. In fact, the <em>only</em> thing that can take on one with numbers in the millions is another superorganism. There are no true ant predators.

                The fungi most attine ants cultivate belongs to the family <em>Lepiotaceae</em>. The fungi rarely grows into a mushroom; they usually spread as hyphae. Most attine-cultivated fungi are unable to survive outsied the care of their cultivators but a few clades are capable of surviving on their own. An early split in the lineage of the ansectoral free-living fungi saw one group become coral shaped and cultivated by the lower attine genus Apterostigma and become unable to survive in the wild. The next branch in the still free-living line saw one group forgo life in the wild <em>again</em> and was cultivated by numerous lower attine genera. Eventually, one group of this clade did become free living again. The next split in the still-free living line led to one group being cultivated yet again. Eventually, some members of this clade reverted one again and another became yeast-like and was cultivatedby the lower attine genus <em>Cyphomyrmex</em>. The remaining groups were all cultivated by numrous lower ttine genera, except one group, which evolved swolllen hyphae tips to provide more nutrirtio to their <em>higher</em> attine cultivators. This group split into two, one of which was cultivted by the genera <em>Sericomyrmex</em> and <em>Trachymyrmex</em>. The other group, the species <em>Leucocoprinus gongylophorus</em>, was cultivated by both of the Leafcutter Ant genera, <em>Atta</em> and <em>Acromyrmex</em>.

                Leafcutter Ants are the among the pinnacles of 140 million years of Formicidae evolution. With several more tens of million of years, how will attines continue to evolve?
